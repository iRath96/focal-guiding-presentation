🔥 Check out our video recording [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/2gMt0WzSVpM)!

This repository contains all source code of our [Motion Canvas](https://motioncanvas.io) presentation for our SIGGRAPH 2023 presentation of our [Focal Path Guiding](https://graphics.cg.uni-saarland.de/publications/rath-2023-focal-guiding.html) paper.
The implementation of our paper can be found [here](https://github.com/iRath96/focal-guiding).
